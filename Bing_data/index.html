                        Binghamton /ˈbɪŋəmtən/ is a city in, and the county seat
                        of, Broome County, New York, United States. It lies in
                        the state's Southern Tier region near the Pennsylvania
                        border, in a bowl-shaped valley at the confluence of the
                        Susquehanna and Chenango Rivers. Binghamton is the
                        principal city and cultural center of the Binghamton
                        metropolitan area (also known as Greater Binghamton, or
                        historically the Triple Cities), home to a quarter
                        million people. The population of the city itself,
                        according to the 2010 census, is 47,376.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From the days of the railroad, Binghamton was a
                        transportation crossroads and a manufacturing center,
                        and has been known at different times for the production
                        of cigars, shoes, and computers. IBM was founded nearby,
                        and the flight simulator was invented in the city,
                        leading to a notable concentration of electronics- and
                        defense-oriented firms. This sustained economic
                        prosperity earned Binghamton the moniker of the Valley
                        of Opportunity. However, following cuts made by defense
                        firms after the end of the Cold War, the region has lost
                        a significant portion of its manufacturing industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, while there is a continued concentration of
                        high-tech firms, Binghamton is emerging as a healthcare-
                        and education-focused city, with the presence of
                        Binghamton University acting as much of the driving
                        force behind this revitalization.

                            Until the mid-1950s, Binghamton saw its population
                            grow rapidly due to its industrial boom, and was one
                            of the largest 100 cities in the United States
                            between 1890 and 1910. Since 1950, the city has
                            experienced sustained population loss, some of which
                            was the result of suburbanization. Much of the
                            recent population loss is skewed towards the younger
                            population, resulting in the growth of the relative
                            proportion of the elderly. (Source:

                        Household size has decreased since the 1990s, consistent
                        with national trends. The average household size in
                        Binghamton was 2.18 persons in 2010, compared with a
                        national average of 2.59. More than 70 percent of the
                        City’s households had one or two people, which indicates
                        greater demand for smaller housing units. Conversely,
                        Broome County and the MSA had higher percentages of
                        larger families which, in turn, indicates greater demand
                        for threebedroom or larger residential units in those
                        areas not located in the City. (Source:

                        Here at Binghamton, as manufacturing has waned and the
                        economy has begun to restructure, the
                        education-and-health and leisure-and-hospitality sectors
                        have become increasingly important. Binghamton
                        University has become the region’s economic centerpiece
                        and has helped stabilize an otherwise struggling area.

                        According to the NY State Department of Labor, the
                        Southern Tier’s economy continues to bounce back from
                        the worst economic downturn in 75 years. Over the 6-year
                        period ending 2016, the region's private sector job
                        count climbed by 5,200, or 2.2% to 237,200. Moreover the
                        region's growing job count has helped to push down the
                        region's unemployment rate from 7.8% in September 2010
                        to 4.9% in September 2016. Chart on the right presents
